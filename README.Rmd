**bases** provides various basis expansions for flexible regression modeling,
including random Fourier features, exact kernel / Gaussian process feature maps,
BART prior features, and a helpful interface for n-way interactions. The
provided functions may be used within any modeling formula, allowing the use of
kernel methods and other basis expansions in modeling functions that do not
otherwise support them.

## Example


## Installation

You can install the development version of bases with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("CoryMcCartan/bases")
