\usage{
b_rff(
  ...,
  p = 100,
  kernel = k_rbf(),
  stdize = c("scale", "box", "symbox", "none"),
  n_approx = nextn(4 * p),

}
\arguments{
\item{...}{The variable(s) to build features for. A single data frame or
matrix may be provided as well. Missing values are not allowed.}

\item{p}{The number of random features.}

\item{kernel}{A kernel function. If one of the recognized kernel functions
such as \code{\link[=k_rbf]{k_rbf()}} is provided, then the computations will be exact.
Otherwise, the fast Fourier transform of the provided kernel function is
used to generate the random features. The kernel should be shift-invariant
and decay to zero at positive and negative infinity.}

\item{stdize}{How to standardize the predictors, if at all. The default
\code{"scale"} applies \code{scale()} to the input so that the features have mean
zero and unit variance, \code{"box"} scales the data along each dimension
to lie in the unit hypercube, and \code{"symbox"} scales the data along each
dimension to lie in \eqn{[-0.5, 0.5]^d}.}

\item{n_approx}{The number of discrete frequencies to use in calculating the
Fourier transform of the provided kernel.  Not used for certain kernels for
which an analytic Fourier transform is available; see above.}

\item{freqs}{Matrix of frequencies to use; \code{ncol(freqs)} must match the number
of predictors. If provided, overrides those calculated automatically, thus
ignoring \code{p} and \code{kernel}.}

\item{phases}{Vector of phase shifts to use. If provided, overrides those
calculated automatically, thus ignoring \code{p} and \code{kernel}.}

\item{shift}{Vector of shifts, or single shift value, to use. If provided,
overrides those calculated according to \code{stdize}.}

\item{scale}{Vector of scales, or single scale value, to use. If provided,
overrides those calculated according to \code{stdize}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of random Fourier features.

\description{
Generates a random Fourier feature basis matrix for a provided kernel,
optionally rescaling the data to lie in the unit hypercube.
Random features are of the form \deqn{
  \phi(x) = \cos(\omega^T x + b),
} where \eqn{\omega} is a vector of frequencies sampled from the Fourier
transform of the kernel, and \eqn{b\sim\mathrm{Unif}[-\pi, \pi]} is a random
phase shift. The input data \code{x} may be shifted and rescaled before the
feature mapping is applied, according to the \code{stdize} argument.
}
\details{
To reduce the variance of the approximation, a moment-matching transformation
is applied to ensure the sampled frequencies have mean zero, per Shen et al.
(2017).  For the Gaussian/RBF kernel, second moment-matching is also applied
to ensure the analytical and empirical frequency covariance matrices agree.

\examples{
data(quakes)

m = ridge(depth ~ b_rff(lat, long), quakes)
plot(fitted(m), quakes$depth)

# more random featues means a higher ridge penalty
m500 = ridge(depth ~ b_rff(lat, long, p = 500), quakes)
c(default = m$penalty, p500 = m500$penalty)

# A shorter length scale fits the data better (R^2)
m_025 = ridge(depth ~ b_rff(lat, long, kernel = k_rbf(scale = 0.25)), quakes)
c(
  len_1 = cor(quakes$depth, fitted(m))^2,
  len_025 = cor(quakes$depth, fitted(m_025))^2
)
