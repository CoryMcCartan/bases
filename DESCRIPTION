Description: Provides various basis expansions for flexible regression modeling,
    including random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2007)
    <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/file/013a006f03dbc5392effeb8f18fda755-Paper.pdf>,
    exact kernel / Gaussian process feature maps, prior features for Bayesian
    Additive Regression Trees (BART) (Chipman et al., 2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285>,
    and a helpful interface for n-way interactions. The provided functions may
    be used within any modeling formula, allowing the use of kernel methods and
    other basis expansions in modeling functions that do not otherwise support
    them. Along with the basis expansions, a number of kernel functions are also
    provided, which support kernel arithmetic to form new kernels. Basic ridge
    regression functionality is included as well.
