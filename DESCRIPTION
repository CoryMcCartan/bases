Description: Provides various basis expansions for flexible regression modeling,
    including random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2007), exact kernel / 
    Gaussian process feature maps, BART (Chipman et al., 2010)
    <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285> prior features, and a helpful interface for n-way 
    interactions. The provided functions may be used within any modeling formula, 
    allowing the use of kernel methods and other basis expansions in modeling 
    functions that do not otherwise support them.  Along with the basis 
    expansions, a number of kernel functions are also provided, which support
    kernel arithmetic to form new kernels. Basic ridge regression functionality
    is included as well.
